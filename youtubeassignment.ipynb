Also, most people believe magistrate judges are trained. This is a common belief. MAGISTRATE JUDGES ARE NOT TRAINED IN THE LAW AT ALL!!! THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO LAW DEGREES AT ALL. YET THESE PEOPLE ARE SIGNING OFF ON HOME INVASION SEARCH WARRANTS, ARREST WARRANTS, PRACTICING TRAFFIC COURTS, ASSIGNING BAIL, TAKING PLEAS ETC. THE ONLY REQUIREMENTS TO BE A MAGISTRATE JUDGE IN MOST STATES IS BEING OVER AGE 25, RESIDING IN THE COUNTY TO SERVE, SOME REQUIRE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA/EQUIVALENT AND SOME DO NOT REQUIRE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AT ALL. SUCH AS IN KENTUCKY A COMMON WEALTH STATE. THEY CAN BE APPOINTED BY PARTISAN OR ALONG PARTISAN LINES OR ELECTED. WHY PUT ANYONE IN CHARGE OF IMPLEMENTING LAWS THEY ARE NOT EVEN QUALIFIED TO DECIPHER FOR THE MOST PART. SO OUR CROOKED JUDICIAL SYSTEM IS BASED ON DUMMIES DOING JOBS THAT THEY HAVE NO DEGREES TO UNDERSTAND OR EVEN DECENT TRAINING TO UNDERSTAND. THEREFORE IT IS BASICALLY A GANG TRYING TO IMPLEMENT LAWS THEY ARE NOT TRAINED IN AT ALL. THE ENTIRE SYSTEM IS FLAWED COMPLETELY. SO BASIC DUMMIES ARE ALLOWED TO FORCE COMPLIANCE HAVING NO TRUE UNDERSTAND OR DEGREES IN THE LAW. JUST TAKE YOUR TIME AND REALLY THINK ABOUT THAT!!!\n",

Because their emails &amp; phone calls are not being treated professionally so when they get 10 shades of pissed they finally come in so what do you expect? It&#39;s telling you that your system isn&#39;t working! Ignoring people makes them angry.  Address their emails, return their calls and this wouldn&#39;t happen. <br><br>But most importantly LISTEN TO THEIR CONCERNS  without being defensive. If you do that, you might learn something you didn&#39;t know &amp; be able to fix something you didn&#39;t understand before. <br><br>Additionally, any Sherrif that cannot handle a disgruntled community member has no business being sheriff or having a gun &amp; badge because maintaining an even temper when others are loosing theirs and take in information (even information delivered in an emotional state) is an imperative skill so then you can discern details underlying the emotion &amp; get to the root. Frazee has none of those skills. This was eye opening &amp; I hope the voters see how easily he looses his temper (which opens him up to bias &amp; judgement clouded by emotion on duty) which we do not need in ANY law enforcement or judicial roles. <br><br>Now the clerk, she doesn&#39;t have that high of a bar to meet as she cannot remove someone&#39;s liberty or use deadly force with immunity. However, she does need to understand that her job as a public servant requires her to follow the law &amp; serve the public even if she doesn&#39;t like them or agree with them. At any point, a pleasant encounter with James would yield zero phone calls. (I do not agree with leaving horrible messages) but HERE&#39;S THE DEAL, if you&#39;ll act this way when you know you are on camera, then how horrible must it be when you are not on camera? That&#39;s what we are left with EVERY SINGLE TIME after watching these. Because if I&#39;m on camera. I&#39;M ON MY BEST BEHAVIOR!
